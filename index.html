    <h3 class="introphrase">We are pleased to introduce you to the once in a lifetime experience from our company Cougar!</h3>
    <h2>So what is Cougar?</h2>
    <p>Cougar is a company founded in 2023 with the intent on creating unique experiences for our clients who have the 
        desire to meet and see dangerous wild cats and animals up close and personal. With our trained professionals you 
        can schedule a tour at one of our state of the art facilities where you can meet and play with the cubs of some 
        of the most dangerous animals in the world!
    </p>
    <h2>Why start Cougar?</h2>
    <p>We found that most private zoos and facilities of the sort are not maintained properly and that many of the animals
        are maltreated to expolit them for profit. Our company is run as non-profit, and all the income goes 100% back into 
        the maintaining habitats and hiring professionals to oversee operations. We pride ourselves in allowing guests the 
        unique experience of getting to play with the cubs of these animals, while making sure they follow precautions and 
        treat the animals with upmost respect and care.
